# InverseOfNumber
📘 Definition: Digit Inverse (Digit Reversal or Positional Inversion)
Digit Inverse (not a formal mathematical term) refers to a custom transformation where the digits of a number are rearranged based on a specific rule or pattern, often used in puzzles, data encoding, or programming tasks.
This is not the same as additive or multiplicative inverse in mathematics.

✅ Examples of Different Types of Digit-Based “Inversion”:
1. Simple Digit Reversal
Definition: Reverse the digits from left to right.

Example:
Original: 21453
Inverse: 35412

2. Sorted Digits (Ascending or Descending Order)
Definition: Sort the digits to get a new number.

Example (Ascending):
Original: 21453
Inverse: 12345

Example (Descending):
Original: 21453
Inverse: 54321

3. Mapped Digit Inversion (Custom Pattern)
Definition: Change each digit to another digit based on a fixed mapping rule (e.g., like a mirror or encoding).

Example Mapping:

0 → 9
1 → 8
2 → 7
...
9 → 0
Original: 21453
Inverse: 78546

4. Digit Position Swap (Index-Based Inversion)
Definition: Reorder digits based on position logic (e.g., swap 1st with last, 2nd with 2nd last, etc.).

Example:
Original: 21453
Inverse: 35412 (Swap 1st↔5th, 2nd↔4th)

5. Digit Position Mapping (like your 21453 → 23154)
Definition: Digits are moved according to some custom index or permutation logic.

Example: Let’s assume a rule like:

Index:     0 1 2 3 4
Original:  2 1 4 5 3
New pos:   0→0, 1→2, 2→1, 3→4, 4→3
Result:    2 4 1 3 5 → 24135
This would depend on a defined rule set or algorithm.

🚫 Important Note:
None of these are true mathematical inverses. They’re digit rearrangements, commonly used in:

Puzzles

Number games

Cryptography

Algorithms involving permutations or encodings
